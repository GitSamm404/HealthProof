# 🏥 HealthProof – Secure Medical Report Verification on Blockchain

**HealthProof** is a decentralized smart contract built on the **Celo blockchain** to securely store and verify patient medical reports using cryptographic hashes.  
It ensures that patient data remains tamper-proof, transparent, and accessible only by authorized entities such as hospitals or administrators.

## 📖 Project Description

In traditional healthcare systems, medical reports are often stored on centralized databases that are vulnerable to tampering, loss, or unauthorized access.  
**HealthProof** addresses this problem by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure **data integrity, privacy, and verification** of medical records.

Each medical report is stored **off-chain** (e.g., on IPFS or cloud) and only its **cryptographic hash** is saved on the blockchain.  
This allows for verification without exposing sensitive data on the public ledger.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Allows hospitals or authorized admins to **store and update** patient medical report metadata on-chain.  
- Enables anyone (patients, doctors, or auditors) to **verify** the authenticity of a medical report using its hash.  
- Provides **transparent access** to report details without compromising patient privacy.

## 🌟 Features

✅ **Decentralized Storage Reference** – Stores only the hash of reports (IPFS, cloud, etc.) on blockchain for security.  
✅ **Immutable Verification** – Verifies if a report hash matches the one recorded on-chain, preventing tampering.  
✅ **Owner-Restricted Access** – Only the contract owner (hospital/admin) can store or update reports.  
✅ **Transparency & Auditability** – Anyone can view report metadata and verify authenticity.  
✅ **Celo Network Integration** – Deployed on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet**, enabling low-cost, eco-friendly transactions.
